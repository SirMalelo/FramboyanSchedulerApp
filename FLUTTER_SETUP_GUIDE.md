## ðŸ“± Your App Structure Will Look Like:
```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart                 # App entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/                   # Data models
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user.dart
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ class.dart
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ booking.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/                 # API calls
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth_service.dart
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ class_service.dart
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api_client.dart
